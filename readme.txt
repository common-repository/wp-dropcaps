Turn the first letter or character in your paragraph into a drop cap with a shortcode.

== Description ==

I tried two drop-cap plugins available in the worpress community. What I noticed is that both are not supporting characters like Chinese. So I just build one my own. wp-dropcaps makes it easy to change the first letter or character into a drop-cap. 
Example: [dc]T[/dc]his is my paragraph with a drop cap. The first letter 'T' will turn into a drop cap. And, [dc]测[/dc]试插件, the character '测' will be drop-capped.
If you don't want your article have a drop cap, just leave it the way used to.

== Shortcode Guide ==
Open the shortcode with [dc], and close it with [/dc]. The inbetween content will turn to drop-cap.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `wp-dropcaps.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate `wp-dropcaps` through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Now you can write your first article with a drop cap, or edit an old one.
4. Edit the plugin to change css style to fit with your theme/design.
